          As part of my interview with a company, Aha-login is a full-stack app
          I created in order to fulfill their senior full-stack engineer
          requirement. The requirements were complex, and required a few weeks
          of my time. They included a React front-end and a Node-backend, and
          integration with GraphQL as well as Auth0's management API in order to
          obtain detailed login statistics about not only the user, but all
          users. The full description, exam requirements and my complete code
          are available
