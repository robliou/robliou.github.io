         <p> My name is Rob. I have been on this planet for over 40 years. I am a Christian, married, and have a kid on the way. </p> 
            <p> I enjoy reading (history, science), playing basketball, watching sports, travelling, talking to people, eating, playing piano, learning new things, etc. 
                I speak English, Mandarin, Spanish, and a few other languages. I feel very blessed. Praise God.</p>
